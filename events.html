          <h4>San Ginés: The Patron Saint</h4>
          <p>San Ginés was born in France, in Arlés. He was a soldier until he was appointed secretary to a Roman magistrate. While carrying out his duties, he was ordered to copy a decree of persecution against Christians. After converting to Christianity, he was appointed Bishop of Clermont and is regarded as a defender of the faith.</p>
          <p>The history of Arrecife is closely linked to the parish of Saint Ginés. The church became the starting point for the city's growth until it was established as a municipality and, since the mid-19th century, the capital of Lanzarote.</p>
