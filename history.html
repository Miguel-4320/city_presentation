              alt="César Manrique - Artist and Architect"
            />
            <p>
              Born in Arrecife, April 24, 1919 and passed away in Teguise,
              September 25, 1992. Was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and artist,
              known particularly for the architectural projects in which he
              participated as artistic director. He combined his work with the
              defense of the environmental values ​​of the Canary Islands. He
              sought harmony between art and nature as a creative space. He
              received, among others, the World Prize for Ecology and Tourism
              and the Europa Prize.

            <p>
              He was born in Antigua, Fuerteventura, on December 25, 1928, and
              died in Arrecife, Lanzarote, on May 4, 2003. He was a Spanish
              landscape architect and construction consultant. He lived most of
              his life in Lanzarote. From 1968, Soto worked closely with César
              Manrique; together they were key figures in the island's
              development. While Manrique's name is well-known, Soto is almost
              forgotten. He was reluctant to seek the spotlight, as he was a
              modest man who did his work quietly and did not speak to the
              press. A permanent exhibition of his work was established at
              Jameos del Agua at the end of 2017.

              He was born in Arrecife on December 18, 1883, and died there on
              January 18, 1966. He was a Spanish physician who practiced
              medicine throughout his life on the island of Lanzarote during the
              20th century. After declining an offer of a position as physician
              at the Spanish Embassy in Paris, he settled in Arrecife to
              practice as a family doctor. At that time, resources were scarce,
              and he relied on the help of the few doctors and medical
              practitioners on the island. In October 1913, he founded the
              School of Arts and Crafts, becoming its first director.

              field to study and document species in situ, and named in his
              honor: Helianthemum gonzalezferreri.

            <h4>Castillo de San Gabriel</h4>
            <img
              src="assets/images/sanGabrielCastillo.jpg"
              alt="Castillo de San Gabriel"
            />
            <p>
              Another interesting attraction is the fortress of Castillo de San
              Gabriel, built on an islet called "Islote del Quemado" (Burned
              Islet) because it was burned during an attack by Turkish-Algerian
              pirates in 1586.History reflects how vulnerable Arrecife was to
              maritime attacks and how its coastal location, with volcanic rock
              reefs surrounding its shoreline and protecting the island,
              influenced its name. Since 1972, it has housed an Archaeological
              and Ethnographic Museum where it is possible to admire
              archaeological remains from different periods.

          <article class="place-card">
            <h4>Puente de las Bolas</h4>
            <img
              src="assets/images/puenteBolas.jpg"
              alt="Puente de las Bolas - Ball Bridge"
            />
            <p>
              Built in 1771, its main function was to serve as a defense against
              pirate attacks. Located on a small island next to the castle and
              connecting it to the Arrecife shore, its walkway would rise if
              enemies approached, isolating and protecting the fortress. In
              another era, it was the only link between the port and the rest of
              the city of Arrecife. On one of the bridge's pillars, there is a
              plaque inscribed in ancient Roman script that welcomed merchants
              and conquerors. The Puente de Las Bolas (Bridge of the Balls) is
              like a miniature Pillar of Hercules, as it supports the two
              symbolic globes of the world. <br /><b>Did you know that?</b
              ><br />
              It has been restored several times to keep it in perfect
              condition. From it, you can see the Arrecife coastline and the
              Gran Hotel. It is also a popular spot for fishermen, rod in hand,
              throughout the day, and in summer, a popular diving spot for local
              youth.

          <article class="place-card">
            <h4>Orientation of churches</h4>
            <img
              src="assets/images/iglesiasOrientadas.jpg"
              alt="Orientation of Churches in Lanzarote"
            />
            <p>
              An archaeoastronomical study found that many ancient churches in
              Lanzarote, including those in Arrecife, are not oriented eastward
              (as was common in many European churches) but rather
              north-northeastward, a pattern unique to the island. This suggests
              that in Lanzarote, wind conditions, volcanic terrain, climate, and
              even local tradition may have had a greater influence than the
              canonical norm of ecclesiastical orientation. In short, human and
              environmental need prevailed over the standard "rule."
