        <h3>Historical curiosities</h3>
        <article class="place-card">
          <h4>Castillo de San Gabriel and the "Islote del Quemado"</h4>
          <img src="assets/images/castillo.jpg" alt="Castillo de San Gabriel" />
          <p>
            Another notable attraction is the Castillo de San Gabriel, built on
            an islet called the "Islote del Quemado" (Burned Islet) because it
            was set on fire during an attack by Turkish-Algerian pirates in
            1586. The history reflects how vulnerable Arrecife was to maritime
            attacks and how its coastal location, with volcanic rock reefs
            surrounding and protecting its shoreline, even influenced the city's
            name.
          </p>

        <article class="place-card">
          <h4>Puente de las Bolas</h4>
          <img
            src="assets/images/puentebolas.webp"
            alt="Puente de las Bolas - Ball Bridge"
          />
          <p>
            The access bridge to the castle, the well-known Puente de las Bolas
            (Ball Bridge), has two stone balls in its structure and has become a
            symbol of the historic town.

        <article class="place-card">
          <h4>Orientation of churches</h4>
          <p>
            An archaeoastronomical study found that many ancient churches in
            Lanzarote, including those in Arrecife, are not oriented eastward
            (as was common in much of Europe) but rather north-northeastward, a
            pattern that appears unique to the island. This suggests that wind
            conditions, volcanic terrain, climate, and local tradition may have
            had a greater influence than the canonical norm of ecclesiastical
            orientation.
