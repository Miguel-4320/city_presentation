              <p>
                Another interesting attraction is the fortress of Castillo de San Gabriel, built on an islet called "Islote del Quemado" (Burned Islet) because it was burned during an attack by Turkish-Algerian pirates in 1586.History reflects how vulnerable Arrecife was to maritime attacks and how its coastal location, with volcanic rock reefs surrounding its shoreline and protecting the island, influenced its name. Since 1972, it has housed an Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum where it is possible to admire archaeological remains from different periods.

                alt="Puente de las Bolas - Ball Bridge"
              />
              <p>
              Built in 1771, its main function was to serve as a defense against pirate attacks. Located on a small island next to the castle and connecting it to the Arrecife shore, its walkway would rise if enemies approached, isolating and protecting the fortress. In another era, it was the only link between the port and the rest of the city of Arrecife. On one of the bridge's pillars, there is a plaque inscribed in ancient Roman script that welcomed merchants and conquerors. The Puente de Las Bolas (Bridge of the Balls) is like a miniature Pillar of Hercules, as it supports the two symbolic globes of the world. <br><b>Did you know that?</b><br>
              It has been restored several times to keep it in perfect condition. From it, you can see the Arrecife coastline and the Gran Hotel. It is also a popular spot for fishermen, rod in hand, throughout the day, and in summer, a popular diving spot for local youth.

                alt="Orientation of Churches in Lanzarote"
              />
              <p>
                An archaeoastronomical study found that many ancient churches in Lanzarote, including those in Arrecife, are not oriented eastward (as was common in many European churches) but rather north-northeastward, a pattern unique to the island.
This suggests that in Lanzarote, wind conditions, volcanic terrain, climate, and even local tradition may have had a greater influence than the canonical norm of ecclesiastical orientation. In short, human and environmental need prevailed over the standard "rule."

            <p>
              Ancient churches in Lanzarote are often oriented
              north-northeastward due to wind conditions and terrain, rather
              than the usual eastward.
